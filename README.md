Previously, I worked as an AI Research Intern at Symbiosis Centre of Applied AI and worked on - Gas Detection Using Multi Sensor Fusion.

After that, I worked with Vodafone Intelligent Solutions as a Software Developer improving Business Process Design and Workflow, building Rich UI Interfaces with Javascript, SQL, RESTAPIs in Bonitasoft BPM.

Currently, I have been working with Suvidha Foundation as a Data Science Intern on 'Text Summarization Using Rejection Learning'.


During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Research Intern at SCAAI and published 3 publications in reputed journals. -

1. Gas Detection and Identification Using Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Based Sensor Fusion, published in Applied System Innovation, MDPI
